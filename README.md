# E-Commerce-Dimensional-Modelling-And-Data-Analysis
This project presents a comprehensive analysis and data-modeling workflow designed to understand and optimize the order management processes of an e-commerce business. Leveraging the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), the study evaluates operational performance across five core business functions and builds an efficient Power BI data model to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview
E-commerce operations involve multiple interconnected processes—from order placement to customer feedback. This project aims to uncover performance patterns, identify bottlenecks, and propose actionable improvements by analyzing real-world data.

The analysis is centered around the following business processes:

- Order Placement
- Order Fulfillment & Shipment
- Invoicing & Payments
- Exchanges & Returns
- Customer Reviews & Feedback

A scalable Power BI semantic model was designed to support these analyses using industry-standard modeling practices.
